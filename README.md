# Thermostat

This project models a simple thermostat that:
- Shows the current temperature
- Can increase the temperature
- Can decrease the temperature
- Can reset the temperature to a default of 20
- Lets the user select a city of their choice and shows the temperature there

The business logic is hooked up to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery. It is linked to the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

It uses JavaScript to fetch this data and display it on the page without refreshing.

It is underpinned by the Jasmine testing framework and was built using TDD.
